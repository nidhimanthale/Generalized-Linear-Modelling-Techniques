# Plot graphs of explanatory variables
plot(Gender, Prop)
# Females are more likely to change their behaviour related to hygiene 
# than males
plot(Severe, Prop)
# People who believe that the consequences of contracting swine flu 
# were severe are more likely change their behaviour related to hygiene
plot(Information, Prop)
# People who believe that the information available about swine flu 
# was adequate are more likely to change their behaviour related to hygiene
