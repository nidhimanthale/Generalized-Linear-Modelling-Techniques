### About the Data ###
Data were collected on a random sample of people during a swine flu outbreak. The purpose of this research was to understand what factors influenced the change of behaviour relating to hygiene. The factors that were taken into account are the Age and Gender of the person, whether the person believed in consequences of contracting swine flu were severe or not and if the person believed the information available about the swine flu was adequate or not.

In our analysis of data we will view change in behaviour as the response or dependent variable of Age, Gender, Severe and Information as predictors.
The response has two categories: Yes or No. 
All predictors are categorical.
Age is categorized into 4 groups: 0-40, 40-50, 50-60 and 60+.
Severe and Information are simple dichotomy coded and therefore are categorical covariates.
Severe: Yes or No
Information: Adequate or Not Adequate
